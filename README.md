# ViTalErt
The purpose of this project is to predict the risk of an ICU patient getting diagnosed with venous thromboembolism (VTE), a condition that occurs when a blood clot forms, often in the deep veins of the leg. VTE can be fatal. It is a problem in hospitalized patients because they are less mobile than the general population. In many hospitals, "high-risk" patients are given prophylaxis for VTE, but the prophylaxis has the potential to cause bleeding. Different hospitals use different protocols to determine whether the prophylaxis should be administered to each patient. Therefore, the goal of this project is to identify a patient's risk of developing VTE so that the medical professional can administer prophylaxis when appropriate to do so.

# Data
The data comes from the [eICU Collaborative Research Database](https://eicu-crd.mit.edu/), which I accessed through Physionet. Although the data is publicly available, in order to access it, you need to obtain approval. Therefore, I have not included the data on github.

# Running the app
